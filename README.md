Hi there 👋

### I'm a Software Engineer, and a life-long Computer Science student.


- ⚙️  What I'm doing at work: Back-end engineering and DevOps
- 🌱 I write about stuff I learn and build at:
    [dhruvs.space](https://dhruvs.space) and [wiki.dhruvs.space](https://wiki.dhruvs.space)
- 💙 Developer tools

These days I'm hacking on:

- [punchout](https://github.com/dhth/punchout) takes the suck out of logging time on JIRA
- [layitout](https://github.com/dhth/layitout) gives you a high level overview of various constructs in your code files
- [act3](https://github.com/dhth/act3) lets you glance at the last 3 runs of your Github Actions
- [schemas](https://github.com/dhth/schemas) lets you inspect postgres schemas in the terminal
- [ecsv](https://github.com/dhth/ecsv) helps you quickly check the versions of your systems running in ECS tasks across various environments
- [kplay](https://github.com/dhth/kplay) lets you inspect messages in a Kafka topic in a simple and
    deliberate manner
- [cueitup](https://github.com/dhth/cueitup) lets you inspect messages in an AWS SQS queue in a simple
    and deliberate manner
- [outtasync](https://github.com/dhth/outtasync) lets you quickly identify the
  CloudFormation stacks that have gone out of sync with the state represented by
  their counterpart stack files.
