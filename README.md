Hi there 👋
===

### I'm a Software Engineer, and a life-long Computer Science student.


- ⚙️  What I'm doing at work: Back-end engineering and DevOps
- 🌱 I write about stuff I learn and build at:
    [dhruvs.space](https://dhruvs.space) and [wiki.dhruvs.space](https://wiki.dhruvs.space)
- 💙 Developer tools

These days I'm hacking on:
